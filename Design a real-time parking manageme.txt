Design a real-time parking management control dashboard for a vehicle parking system called KHA-PARKING.

The UI must look like an industrial monitoring software, not a modern SaaS dashboard.

Resolution target: 1920x1080 fullscreen desktop.

Style: security monitoring system, dense information, operational environment used by parking operators.

HEADER (Full Width Top Bar)

Create a horizontal header divided into 3 sections:

LEFT

Company Logo

System name: KHA-PARKING

Bold uppercase text

CENTER

Real-time clock display

Format:
28/02/2026 - 09:41:52

Digital clock style

Updates every second

Large readable font

RIGHT

Display system statistics:

Total visitor revenue (Tổng doanh thu vãng lai)

Vehicles inside parking (Xe trong bãi)

Vehicles outside parking (Xe ngoài bãi)

Use compact statistic cards aligned horizontally.

BODY LAYOUT

The body is divided into 2 vertical lanes:

LEFT SIDE → EXIT LANE (Làn Ra)

RIGHT SIDE → ENTRY LANE (Làn Vào)

Both lanes must be symmetrical.

EACH LANE STRUCTURE
1️⃣ LIVE CAMERA AREA (TOP)

Two live camera frames:

LEFT: License plate close-up camera

RIGHT: Front overview camera

Requirements:

Same height as the information block (approx. 4 info rows)

Video placeholder style

Thin borders

Dark monitoring background

2️⃣ LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION SECTION

Below live cameras:

Two small license plate image frames:

Entry lane: only one active plate image

Exit lane: shows entry & exit comparison plates

Under each plate image:

AI detected license plate text

Large bold font

Layout:
Plate images aligned horizontally.

3️⃣ VEHICLE CARD INFORMATION PANEL

Next to license plate images display vehicle/card info:

Information rows:

Row 1:

Card ID | Card Type | Parking Duration (empty for monthly cards)

Row 2:

Card Owner | Registered License Plate

Row 3:

Card Registration Period (start date – expiry date)

Row 4:

Entry Time | Exit Time

Layout style:

Grid/table format

Compact industrial UI

High readability

4️⃣ EMPTY FUNCTIONAL AREA

Next to AI plate recognition area:

ENTRY lane → keep empty

EXIT lane → display parking fee calculation area

This area must align horizontally with plate recognition section.

5️⃣ CAPTURED IMAGE AREA

Below the main content:

Two additional camera frames showing:

Captured snapshot images saved into system

Must mirror layout of live cameras above.

6️⃣ STATUS NOTIFICATION BAR (BOTTOM)

At bottom of each lane:

A full-width notification bar showing system messages:

Examples:

Waiting for vehicle

License plate mismatch

Access granted

Please proceed

Color logic:

Blue → waiting

Green → success

Red → warning/error

Must resemble industrial alert system.

VISUAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS

Monitoring/control room aesthetic

Minimal rounded corners

Dense layout spacing

Sharp borders

Dark gray panels

Deep blue header

Red highlight for license plate mismatch

Green highlight for valid recognition

Avoid:

Modern SaaS card style

Excessive whitespace

Mobile-first layout

TECH TARGET

Design components suitable for:

React / Next.js

Tailwind CSS

WebSocket realtime updates

Live camera streaming placeholders

OUTPUT

Generate a high-fidelity operational dashboard UI ready for development handoff.

Responsive & Multi-Monitor Optimization

The parking dashboard must scale perfectly across different desktop monitor sizes commonly used in control rooms:

Supported displays:

19 inch (1366×768)

21 inch (1600×900)

24 inch (1920×1080) → PRIMARY TARGET

27 inch (2560×1440)

Layout Behavior
1. Fixed Logical Structure (NO MOBILE REFLOW)

The UI must never stack vertically like a mobile layout.

Entry Lane and Exit Lane must always remain side-by-side.

Maintain symmetrical dual-lane monitoring layout.

2. Fluid Grid Scaling

Use proportional layout instead of fixed pixels:

Header height: 6–8% of screen height

Camera areas scale proportionally

Information panels expand horizontally

Notification bars keep fixed readable height

Prefer:

CSS Grid

Flexbox

percentage widths

viewport units (vw / vh)

Avoid fixed px-based layouts.

3. Smart Font Scaling

Fonts must scale automatically:

License plate text → always dominant visual element

Clock font increases on larger screens

Minimum readable size on 1366×768

Use:

clamp()

rem units

responsive typography scale

Example:

font-size: clamp(14px, 1.2vw, 24px);
4. Camera Frame Scaling Rules

Camera frames must:

Maintain aspect ratio (16:9)

Expand proportionally with screen size

Never overflow container

Never create vertical scrolling

Dashboard must fit entirely on one screen without scrolling.

5. Density Adaptation

Smaller screens (19"):

Reduce padding

Compact info rows

Keep all information visible

Larger screens (27"):

Increase spacing slightly

Expand camera visibility

Maintain operator readability from distance

6. Operator Viewing Distance Optimization

UI must remain readable from 1.5–2 meters away:

Large plate numbers

High contrast text

Clear alert colors

This is an industrial monitoring interface, not a consumer web app.

7. Technical Implementation Target

Design compatible with:

CSS Grid auto-fit / auto-fill

Tailwind responsive breakpoints

Fullscreen kiosk mode

Multi-monitor environment

Output Requirement

Provide layout behavior demonstrating how UI adapts between:

1366×768

1920×1080

2560×1440

without changing structural layout.
